<h3>Song Choice: Slime You Out - Produced by Drake and SZA</h3>

<p>I don't know what's wrong with you girls
    I feel like y'all don't need (LOVE)
    You need somebody who could micromanage you
    You know what I'm sayin'? Tell you right from wrong
    Who's smart from who's a fool
    Which utensil to use for which (FOOD), like
    I got a schedule to attend to, though
    I can't relate
    (6ix)

    You bitches really get carried away
    Makin' mistakes, then you beg me to stay
    Got me wiggin' on you like I'm Arrogant Tae
    You got my mind in a terrible place
    Whipped and chained you like AMERICAN SLAVES
    Act like you not used to Sheraton stays
    I met the nigga you thought could replace
    How were there even comparisons made?
    Bitch, next time, I swear on my grandmother GRAVE
    I'm slimin' you for them kid choices you made

    Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slimin' you out

    Ayy, this ain't the littest I could get on you bitches
    Send wires on wires on wires like Idris
    You LUCKY that I don't take back what was given
    I could have you on payment plan 'til you're 150
    And my slime right here, she got some bars for y'all niggas
    So I'ma fall back and let SZA talk her shit for a minute

    Slimin' you out, slimin' you out, slime

    Damn, these niggas got me so twisted
    How the fuck you so real, but play bitch on my line?
    I can feel what you're spinnin'
    Got too much PRIDE to let no burnt nigga slime me out
    Pull up, go write about
    My night, got time, let's discuss all those lies about

    Frontin' out here like you diggin' me out
    And I ain't even cummin', I'm in and out
    And you ain't 'bout the shit you rappin' about
    And I can spin a hoe, I'm airin' it out
    I'm goin' off like a SAWED-OFF
    You tell these hoes you ain't cuddlin'
    But with me, you know you doin' all that shit
    You tellin' these hoes you ain't trickin' off
    But with me, you know I'm gon' get it all

    How you niggas get so carried away?
    Trippin' when that dick is barely third place
    Fucked out of pity, it's cute that you lame
    Dip 'cause it's mid, I can't fake like it's hangin'

    Slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out, I'm slimin' you out
    Oh-whoa, whoa
    
    Yeah
    January, you pretend to see life clearly, yearly
    February is the time that you put the evil eye and the pride aside
    For the fantasy of gettin' married, very scary
    March got you already second guessin' titles
    April, spring is here and just like a spring, you start to spiral
    May brings some warmer days, poolside, gettin' very tan
    June have you movin' ice-cold, goin' back and forth with a married man
    July, that's when I found out you lied

    August, it was "baby" this, "baby" that like you had your tubes tied
    September, we fallin' off, but I'm still the man you tryna win over
    October is all about me 'cause your turn should've been over
    November got you moodboardin' for next year and you're single
    December the gift-givin' month and now you wanna rekindle our year

    Tryna build trust, showin' me your DMs, how they tryna bag you
    Ironic how the news I got about you ended up bein' bad news
    Get a nigga hit for 50 racks, girl, the beef cost like it's wagyu
    Get a nigga hit, I'll make his ass see the light like a half-moon
    Shout to QC, pretty sure I made Pee M's like it's past noon
    All I really know is W's and M's, life lookin' like a bathroom
    All I really know is M bags like I drove through and ordered fast food
    Sayin' that I'm too guarded with my feelings, who the fuck even asked you?

    Seven bodyguards, just in case somebody really wanna try and crash through
    Don't know why I listen to you when I hear you talkin' to me, it's some half-truths
    If I don't pay your rent, it end up like an old hairstyle, girl, it's past due
    If I don't- Ah-ah-ah, that's as far as I got</p>
